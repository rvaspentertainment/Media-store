If the bot receives a copyright-related file, the file will remain safe, but the file ID (link) may change in a new bot.

You can configure settings such as link shorteners, verification steps, force subscribe (fsub), verification timings, and many more features.

The bot stores your file links (file IDs), so when users access your link, the bot processes it according to your configured settings.

The bot can also display all your stored files to your users if you grant access. This feature works only when you generate a link (not a file link) and share it with your users. We do not store user details. Instead, the link provides necessary user information.

What is a shortener ad site?  
This type of site shortens any kind of link and redirects users to an ad page first. Users must view the ad page and wait for a specified time (10, 20, or 30 seconds, depending on the site) before being directed to the original link.

The CPM (Cost Per Mille) for these ad pages varies. For example, a CPM of 1 means the site pays $1 for 1,000 views. To count as one view, users must watch all ad pages and access the original link.

The minimum CPM is typically 1 (1.5-3 CPM) for one page, while the maximum CPM can reach 9-10 for four pages. Payment is usually made in dollars, but the exchange rate may differ. For instance, if the dollar rate is ₹83, they might pay ₹80 or less."""
